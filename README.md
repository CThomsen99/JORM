# JORM
Java ORM is a Java Object-relational mapper. It's ground up designed by me so do NOT expect something impressive.

## How To Use (just look up the TestProject):
- extend Class PersistentObject
- mark persistent members with @Persistent (or the class to mark all members)
- use setPropertyValue(String, Object) from PersistentObject to change a persistent member value
